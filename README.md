# SQL-Rockbuster-Stealth-Project
Online video service launch strategy

## Project Overview
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a fictional video rental company that is planning to launch an online video rental service.
Working with the Business Intelligence Department, my tasks included loading of all of Rockbusterâ€™s data into a relational database
management system (RDBMS). Then, use SQL to analyze the data and answer any ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have.
